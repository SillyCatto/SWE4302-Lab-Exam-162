1.  File: WareHouse.java
    a)  Line: 8
        code smell: mysterious naming
        reason: 'int i' - this 'i' doesn't make any sense what this is

2.  File: InventorySystem.java
    a)  line: 41
        code smell: long parameter list
        reason: addProduct method takes too many parameters
    b)  line: 44 - 67
        code smell: nested conditionals
        reason: too many nested if blocks
    c)  line: 80, 84-88, 91-94
        code smell: primitive obsession and magic numbers
        reason: the primitive type integers and floats used in these lines like: 0.85, 0.95 are magic numbers
        since they don't convey any meaningful name here
    d)  line: 106, 114, 124
        code smell: message chaining
        reason: globalInventoryData.products.values() is message chaining
    e)  line 106, 107, 124 and 114, 116, 126
        code smell: duplicate code
        reason: these lines are repeated:
                Product product : globalInventoryData.products.values()
                and, total += product.finalPrice * product.stock
    f)  the whole file
        code smell: large class
        reason: its doing a lot of work, violates SRP
